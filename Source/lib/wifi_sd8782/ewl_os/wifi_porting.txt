110622
- marvell wifi stack is working well.
- additional work
  . sdio multi-block read, bug exists in current.
- fpga version 110531 

11/06/23
- fpga version 110622
- porting wifi s/w to the latest Rtos version(11/06/23)
- when sdio clock rate is up, downloading firmware image is error,
- reading sdio multi block mode is implemented.

- fpga & firmware version 110626
- Operating sdio cmd53 read/write is good.
- lwIp stack and socket interface is connected to wifi.
- the value of lwIp option "LWIP_NETIF_TX_SINGLE_PBUF" is modified 0 into 1.
  this option change multi pbuf type into sigle buffer type

  the modified lwip option 
  #include "moal_api.h"                                            //  modified for wifi
  /* Wi-Fi configuration */
  #define ETH_PAD_SIZE                    MLAN_HEADER_SIZE         //  modified for wifi

  #define LWIP_NETIF_TX_SINGLE_PBUF             1 		           // 0 --> 1 modified for wifi
  #define PBUF_POOL_SIZE                        4                  // 8-->4  modified for wifi
  #define PBUF_LINK_HLEN                       (14 + ETH_PAD_SIZE) // modified from 16

 - wifi web server is operated, 
   however TCP_MSS is changed from 536 to 536*2 
   web server is not working.
 - TCP_SND_BUF  is changed into (10*TCP_MSS) 


11/07/05
 - When TCP_MSS is changed large (ex from 536 to 536*2)
   this problom comes from struct of pbuf. pbuf is composed of linked list.
   however marvell wifi'buffer strut is sigle buffer. and linked list pbuf is 
   converted into single. To make single pbuf, pbuf_coalesce() is used in 
   woal_hard_start_xmit()

 - MJPEG'img is tranfered successfully.

 - TCP_MSS, TCP_WND, LWIP_NETIF_TX_SINGLE_PBUF

 - IOCTL wait queue is implemented. Freertos's msg queue is used.
   when ioctrl operation is completed. User or process can be signaled. 

 - moal_recv_event() in moal_shim.c removed wireless_send_event()   
 
11/07/12
- WEP is implemented, Also 64/128 bit mode was tested. the used key is provided 
  by AP. wifi_wep_connect()

- linux's iwconfig function call interface is mimiced by iw_handler struct
  and wext_handle_ioctl()
  
- when memory is alloced by malloc(), the memory should initialized by '0',
  To do this allow s/w to work normally.
